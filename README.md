## Project Description

LowKey Deals is a web application that helps users compare product prices across nearby local offline stores without physically visiting each shop. The platform promotes price transparency, saves time, and supports local retailers by increasing their visibility in the digital space.

## The Problem Statement

In many cities and towns, product prices vary between different local stores. Customers often need to physically visit multiple shops to compare prices of appliances, electronics, or other products. This process is time-consuming, inconvenient, and sometimes leads to buying products at higher prices due to lack of proper comparison.
There is currently no centralized digital platform where customers can easily compare prices from local offline stores in one place.To solve this problem, an Offline Price Comparison Web Application is proposed.
The Solution
As a solution we created a simple offline price comparison web application where local store owners can update their product prices and stock details. Customers can search for products, compare prices from nearby stores, and view store information in one place.
This platform saves time, improves transparency, and helps customers choose the best price while increasing visibility for local shops.

Users can get directions through Google Maps integration, read reviews, and even report the actual price they paid. This ensures transparency and enables community-driven price validation.

Customers can quickly compare deals, view price reductions, and select the best offer using the “View Deal” option.

The system highlights active discounts, shows approximate distance to the store, and allows users to search for specific products, making local price comparison simple, fast, and transparent.

Sellers can enter product details such as name, regular price, sale price, and description, and update stock availability in real time.

The feature ensures that customers always see accurate pricing and availability information, while enabling retailers to easily maintain their digital storefront.
# Additional Documentation
## Backend Architecture

LowKey Deals is built entirely using Streamlit, where both frontend and backend logic are handled within a single Python application.

The app processes user inputs directly and updates product data dynamically using session state and local data storage.

 # Deployment

The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and is accessible at:

https://hack-her-eiw5wjdrmfmz7kjsaxwwnq.streamlit.app/
# Project Demo
## Video

In the demonstration video, we showcase the complete functionality of LowKey Deals, highlighting both the customer and seller experiences. The demo begins with user login to demonstrate role-based access within the platform. From the customer perspective, we show how users can browse available products, view discounted prices, check stock availability, and compare deals from nearby stores. The interface clearly displays price reductions and approximate distance, helping users make informed purchasing decisions. By selecting “View Deal,” users can access a detailed product page that includes the product image, pricing details, store information, Google Maps integration for directions, customer reviews, and an option to report the actual price paid to ensure price transparency and community-driven accuracy.

The demo then transitions to the seller dashboard, where we demonstrate how retailers can add new products, set regular and sale prices, update product descriptions, and manage stock availability. Any changes made by the seller are reflected dynamically in the product listings, showing real-time updates within the system. Finally, the video confirms successful deployment of the application on Streamlit Cloud, proving that the platform is fully functional and accessible online.
